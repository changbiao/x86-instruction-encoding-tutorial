# Introduction

Convert all assembly inputs `.asm` into decompiled hexdump `.hd`:

    sudo apt-get install nasm
    make run

Prerequisites: basics of how x86 assembly works, Intel syntax.

To learn, rotate quickly between:

- the examples
- the general instruction organization
- the Intel manual

until your brain starts to absorb them.
